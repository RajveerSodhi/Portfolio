                I'm Rajveer Sodhi, a final-year Computer Science Honours student at the University
                of British Columbia, also minoring in Data Science. I am passionate about research
                in Computer Science and love being an active member of my community. I am conducting
                research on innovative interaction techniques for AR/VR headesets and explored
                in-vehicle infotainment systems, leveraging tools like C# and Unity. At UBC, I am
                the President of the Film Society. I have also worked as a Supplemental Learning
                Leader and Teaching Assistant, and created content for a Bolylwood dance club.

                I am currently a Software Development Intern at Data POEM, where I develop APIs to
                retrieve and transform website analytics data. My experiences and roles as an SWDev
                have taught me a lot about user-centric design, teamwork and leadership, and agile
                programming practices.
